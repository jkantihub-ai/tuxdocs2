# Modern TLDP: The Linux Documentation Project Reimagined

**Modern TLDP** is an AI-first Progressive Web Application (PWA) that revitalizes the classic Linux Documentation Project. It uses **Google Gemini** to instantly modernize legacy tutorials, simulate terminal commands, and assist users with context-aware chat.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧠 AI-Powered Modernization
*   **Legacy to Modern Translation**: Automatically converts obsolete commands (e.g., `ifconfig`, `iptables`, `SysV init`) into modern standards (`ip`, `nftables`, `systemd`) while preserving the original intent.
*   **Dual-View Mode**: Instantly toggle or view side-by-side comparisons of the **Original Legacy** content and the **AI Modernized** version.
*   **Interactive Walkthroughs**: Converts static text documentation into step-by-step interactive labs with command verification.

### 💻 Virtual AI Terminal
*   **Safe Simulation**: A simulated Ubuntu 24.04 LTS environment that allows users to "run" commands from the documentation safely.
*   **Gemini Reasoning**: The terminal output is generated by Gemini 2.5 Flash, providing realistic responses, error handling, and state simulation without risking your actual machine.

### 🤖 Intelligent Librarian
*   **Semantic Search**: Natural language search finds relevant documents even if keywords don't match exactly.
*   **Executive Briefs**: One-click generation of summaries, separating "The Hook," "Core Commands," and "Admin's Edge" for quick reading.
*   **Context-Aware Chat**: A floating assistant that understands the specific document you are reading and answers questions in context.

### 🛡️ Community & Moderation
*   **AI-Assisted Review**: Users can propose edits to documentation.
*   **Automated Analysis**: The AI analyzes proposals for **Risk Level** (e.g., malicious commands), **Quality Score**, and provides constructive feedback before a human moderator approves them.

### 🎨 Modern Experience
*   **Light & Dark Themes**: Fully responsive design with a clean Light Mode by default and a rich Dark Mode for night hacking.
*   **PWA Ready**: Installable on desktop and mobile with offline capabilities.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Framework**: Angular v19+ (Zoneless, Standalone Components, Signals)
*   **AI Model**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash via `@google/genai` SDK
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
*   **Markdown Parsing**: `marked`
*   **State Management**: Angular Signals

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository**.
2.  **Set your API Key**: Ensure `process.env['API_KEY']` is accessible or hardcoded for local dev (Note: In production, handle keys securely).
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Run the app**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
