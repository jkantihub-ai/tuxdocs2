# Modern TLDP Manifesto

## The Mission
The Linux Documentation Project (TLDP) was once the bible of the open-source world. As technology evolved, many of these guides became historical artifacts rather than practical manuals.

**Modern TLDP** aims to preserve this history while making it useful for the next generation of engineers using Artificial Intelligence.

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Respect the Source
We never delete or overwrite the original content. It is preserved as a historical record. AI content is always clearly labeled as a "Modernization" or "Overlay".

### 2. Educate, Don't Just Solve
The AI is instructed to explain *why* things changed (e.g., why `net-tools` was deprecated in favor of `iproute2`), rather than just giving the new command.

### 3. Safety First
The "Terminal" is sandboxed. We encourage experimentation without the risk of destroying a local environment.
